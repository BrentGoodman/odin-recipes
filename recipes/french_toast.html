        <h3 class="Ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Texas Toast
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Eggs – you will need large eggs for this recipe.
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Milk – you can use your favorite milk or dairy-free milk alternative.
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Salt – add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors and sweetness
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Sweetener – you definitely have options for the sweetener to use based on your personal preferences.
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Flavorings – I love to include vanilla extract and ground cinnamon for a classic French toast flavor. You can omit the cinnamon, if you prefer, or add more for a more pronounced cinnamon French Toast. You can also add nutmeg if you like. 
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Butter – melted on the griddle for cooking and then add a tablespoon butter for serving, if desired.
            </li>
            <li class="ingredients-list">
                Maple syrup – real maple syrup is required in our family for the perfect French toast!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li class="steps-list">
                Whisk. To save on dishes and cleanup, I whisk together the eggs, milk, sweetener, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon right into a shallow dish I’ll use to dip my bread in.
            </li>
            <li class="steps-list">
                Dip. Once I have whisked the egg mixture together well, I place my bread slice in on one side and then quickly flip it over to the other side since some sandwich bread will absorb the liquid super quickly. You’ll want to be sure that you are dipping your bread and not leaving it for any time to soak so that the bread does not absorb too much liquid. Make sure to follow this so your bread does not get too wet. This will prevent your French toast from becoming soggy.
            </li>
            <li class="steps-list">
                Cook. Once both sides of the bread are coated with the liquid, I place them into the skillet with melted butter set over medium heat. They only take a few minutes to cook, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
            </li>
            <li class="steps-list">
                Serve. Serve immediately with your syrup of choice. I also love to serve with fruit like fresh berries (I love blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries). A dollop of homemade whipped cream is always a good idea!
